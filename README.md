BuffedRaid
==========
Is your raid fed and potioned up, ready to pull?

##Goal:
Provide an overlay for keeping track your raids buffed status, such as if they have boost, field tech and food buffs on them.

##Target audience:
Raids or veteran groups as well perhaps. Maybe even rated battlegrounds. Basically whenever you are grouped.

##Features:
* Movable display
* Option to show the display in instanced PvP as well ( or hide it ).
* Report in chat those who don't have buffs at the start of combat.
* Report in chat every 3 min (for field techs mostly)
* Clicking the icon will target that group member (if they are in range) - so you can trade them food or whatever :P
* Alt clicking the icons will report those missing food buffs in chat.
* Ctrl clicking the icons will report those missing potions and field tech in chat.
* Skull icon indicating group member being dead.
